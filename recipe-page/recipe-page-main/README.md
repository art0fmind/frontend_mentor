## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to customize HTML lists using CSS Grid for more control over the layout. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Replace default list markers with custom ones using `::before` and Unicode characters (like `•`).
- Use `display: grid` on list items to align markers and content into two distinct columns.
- Center custom markers within their grid cell using properties like `align-items: center` and `position: relative`.
- Control spacing between items using `margin`, and inside items using `padding`.
- Understand and fix layout issues when text wraps onto multiple lines in `li` elements, ensuring clean and consistent indentation.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my front-end skills by:

- Exploring how to animate custom markers or transitions on hover.
- Making the grid-based list layout more responsive for small screens.
- Trying the same layout using `flexbox` and comparing its behavior with `grid`.
- Applying these techniques to ordered lists (`ol`) with numbered counters for more advanced UI control.
- Creating reusable components or utility classes for styled lists to use across multiple sections of a site.
