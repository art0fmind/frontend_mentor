## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I delved into several key web development concepts, including: A more intelligent use of width and height, with width 100% and height auto. I also realized that it's more useful to set a block's container to a width of 100% and a max-width set. This ensures that the container remains at this size for certain devices.

I also understood the use of `font-optical-sizing: auto;`.

### Continued development

As mentioned previously I would like to have complete control over the width and height properties, not necessarily these properties but the implications they have with the other properties and also depending on the context.
